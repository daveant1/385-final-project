The Sprite Assets folder contains all the files used to import sprites into the game. converter.py converts a .png image input into a .mif file used by the on-chip memory module to load the color indices of the .mif file into on-chip memory. These color indices are then read by the Color Mapper and mapped to a set of RGB values. There are files for two different sprite fighters, as well as for menu objects.
